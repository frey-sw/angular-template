# Configuration
Create the `.env` file for each project, placed on the assets folder of the 3 web platforms (backoffice, scouting-portal, player-portal).
Check the sample.env file to see its content

## Build

There are 3 build scripts, each one for each Web app. (Check package.json)

Run `ng build <project-name>` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
